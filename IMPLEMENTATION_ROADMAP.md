    # 2. Capture while scrolling intelligently
    # 3. Avoid duplicate content
    # 4. Return comprehensive text extraction
    pass
```

### **Step 2: Add Web Intelligence (Next Week)**

```python
def implement_web_intelligence():
    # 1. Detect current browser and URL
    # 2. Extract full page content
    # 3. Parse structured data
    # 4. Integrate with AI analysis
    pass
```

### **Step 3: Context Awareness System (Week 3)**

```python
def implement_context_awareness():
    # 1. Monitor application usage
    # 2. Track user patterns
    # 3. Build contextual understanding
    # 4. Provide intelligent insights
    pass
```
